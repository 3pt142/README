### E8372-153, E5573-609 Zong/Telenor/Airtel/any other 21.329/21.333 secuboot/efuse firmware SIM unlock

I'm offering **free** SIM unlocking service for **any** of **yours** efuse/secuboot Huawei Balong modems.

Almost any efuse/secuboot device could be unlocked. Currently supported, but not limited to these versions and devices:

* e5573Cs Airtel 21.333.64.01.284
* e5573Cs Zong 21.328.62.00.1456
* e5573Cs Zong 21.328.62.00.1460

* e8372 Zong 21.333.64.00.1456

The unlocking is performed with a special unlocking file which you'll need to upload to the modem/router. To request the file, you'll need to get the response of the following commands:

```
AT^VERSION?
AT^DIESN
```

To get the response for AT^DIESN command, you'll have to run custom firmware, which you can find somewhere on the internet or make yourself with https://github.com/Huawei-LTE-routers-mods/huawei_balong_modfw_kitchen.

Send the output of AT commands above to **simunlock@valdikss.org.ru** email and wait for 4-10 days.

The unlock is only for non-commercial usage and for up to 2 of your own devices. Please do NOT contact me for other questions over this email, do NOT include anything other than AT commands output. You need to be technologically competent to install the file by following the readme and figuring out everything by yourself.
