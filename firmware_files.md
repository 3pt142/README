#   Firmware files

Huawei firmware files are not easy to find. Huawei don't publish firmware files on their website, but there are some third-party filrmware archive websites where you can find selected firmware versions.

These archives are usually premium and require paid subscription, but some of the files are available for free.

Here are the links for these archives:

[easy-firmware.com](https://easy-firmware.com/) - mostly premium files  
[combinefile.com](https://combinefile.com/) - lots of free firmware files  
[trustoff.ru](https://trustoff.ru/) - free firmware files  
[3ginfo.ru](https://3ginfo.ru/) - free firmware files  
[androidhost.ru](https://androidhost.ru/)
[firmwarego.com](https://firmwarego.com/)

Most firmware files (including premium) are re-uploaded to 4pda.ru forums, where you can download them for free. You'll have to register to download files, otherwise Error 404 is shown.
